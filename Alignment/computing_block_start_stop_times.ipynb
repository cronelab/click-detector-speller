    "When testing the switch-scanning speller, a video camera was used to capture the participant's movements of his right\n",
    "hand. This is because he would generate clicks by attempting single grasps of his hand and these residual movements\n",
    "were still observable. Thus these were used as ground truth for movement onset. Video of his hand needs to be \n",
    "synchronized to the BCI2000 data that contained neural signals as well as state changes corresponding to clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, the video of the relevant block was cropped (in Premiere Pro) in such a way as to best approximate the start\n",
    "time of BCI2000. Specifically, the starting point of the video (0 seconds) was the first frame when the System Status\n",
    "of the BCI2000 Operator was \"Running\" (the status in the previous frame was \"Waiting...\"). However, there are likely\n",
    "some spelling blocks that do not start at that time frame and this is likely accidental (they can still be synchronized\n",
    "due to the existance of an auditory cue).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this cropping, there may still be an interval of time between when the \"Running\" status appears on BCI2000\n",
    "Operator and when the participant actually starts performing the task. This time may be even 10-20 s long in some\n",
    "cases. Similarly, at the end of the video, there may be a few seconds after the task ends in which the video is still\n",
    "recording. The videos for each spelling block were cropped this way in order to guarantee that all the relevant \n",
    "information was recording, even at the expense of a few seconds at the beginning and the end where the participant may\n",
    "have not have been sitting still and may have been performing miscellaneous movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, we save fine-tuned information describing the truly relevant starting and ending points of the video. \n",
    "Specifically, we append a .txt file with the starting and ending points in units of seconds and frames that were \n",
    "converted from hh:mm:ss:ff units from Premiere Pro.\n",
    "\n",
    "These starting and ending points are then used in two other scripts (curtailing_video_data.ipynb and xxxx.ipynb) to\n",
    "curtail the video information and BCI2000 information respectively.\n"
